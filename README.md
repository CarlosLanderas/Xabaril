Features Toogles and A/B testing library for ASP.NET Core

Feature Toogles is a powerful technique that allows developers to deliver new functionality to users withouth changing code. Provides an alternative to to mantain multiples branches (aka feature branches), such that feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for the release. We can release a version with of our products with unfinished features. These unfinished features are hidden (toggled) for the users.
We can use feature toogling to enable or disable features during run time.
